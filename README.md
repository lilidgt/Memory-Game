This is a simple memory game created as a practice exercise to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is a classic memory card games where players flip cards to find matching pairs.

- **Image Cards**: The game includes various animal images for a fun and engaging experience.
- **Restart Button**: Players can easily restart the game with a click of a button.

## What I used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## To play
Simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The game board will display a grid of cards. Click on the cards to flip them and find matching pairs.

## How to Play
1. Click on any card to flip it over and reveal the image.
2. Try to find the matching pair by flipping over two cards at a time.
3. If the cards match, they will remain flipped. If they do not match, they will be flipped back.
4. Keep playing until all pairs are found!
